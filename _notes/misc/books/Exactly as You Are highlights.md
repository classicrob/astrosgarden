## Highlights
“I’m giving the children myself and whoever I am,” he said in 1974. Anything that’s a part of me becomes a part of the program. My relationship with God, which I feel is very comfortable and healthy, cannot ever be disassociated from who I am on the program, even though I don’t deal in overt theological terms. Our dialog with children constantly includes acceptance of someone exactly as she or he is at the moment. I feel that’s how God operates. Jesus tells us in no uncertain terms that “I like you as you are and let’s grow together from there.”9 — location: [165]() ^ref-65269

Not long after he started walking, between the sounds of passing cars, he heard them—their footfall, a laugh with an edge, and then their voices: “Hey! Fat Freddy! We’re going to get you!” He felt the familiar flush of shame, hot in his belly, creeping up his neck, and his heart began to pound. He heard his parents’ and grandparents’ voices in his mind, speaking their usual counsel: “Just let on that you don’t care,” they urged him. “Then nobody will bother you.” But he did care. He cared very much. — location: [201]() ^ref-44822

“And what’s more,” he said, “I didn’t know it was alright to feel any of those things.”5 — location: [213]() ^ref-27112

Freddy—young, wise Freddy—took on the work of sadness on his own. He cried when he was alone—about the bullies, about his loneliness, about people’s inability to see beyond the outside. — location: [215]() ^ref-60849

A sickly, often lonely boy who got teased by his classmates and struggled with his own body could have grown up into inhibition, bitterness, or bullying. Instead, he grew up into Mister Rogers, a man who looked into the camera every day and offered love, affirmation, and security to millions of scared kids in households across the nation. — location: [242]() ^ref-32960

Margaret McFarland, a renowned child psychologist and Fred’s teacher, consultant, and friend, attributed Fred’s unique insight into children to his ability to stay connected to his own childhood. — location: [247]() ^ref-8435

And so he worked hard, every day of his television career, every time he looked directly into the camera’s lens, to offer something of that home to the children who watched. In the space between his gaze and the gaze of each child watching, he created an intimate world of safety and calm. — location: [250]() ^ref-36553

Mister Rogers’s responses to his viewers’ fears were patient, serious, and thorough. He didn’t ask kids to stop being afraid—though sometimes his careful explanations did alleviate fear—or to stop crying. (It angered Fred to hear adults tell children not to cry, even when those adults were trying to offer comfort.13) Instead, he offered a kind of incarnation through his own loving presence. — location: [264]() ^ref-16906

Jim’s office sat six stories high on the top floor of the tallest building in Latrobe, and from there, he made decisions about his factories and met with other leaders—the owners of the steel mills, plastic molds manufacturer, beer company, and more—when something went wrong in town. His employees came to see him there if they had a problem at home, and he would listen and help in any way he could. When he wanted to visit one of his factories, he would take off his coat and tie, roll up his sleeves, and put a plug of tobacco in his mouth. When he got to the floor, he knew all his employees—at one time, he had over five hundred of them—by name.1 While Jim was ministering to the factory workers’ families and, through them, to the town more broadly, Nancy was carrying out her own service work. Each Christmas, her gift list included hundreds of names.2 She bought a tie each year for every doctor in Latrobe,3 and she knit a sweater each month for someone on her Christmas list. (When Fred grew up, he was a yearly recipient, and Nancy would be sure to make his a zippered cardigan so he could wear it on the Neighborhood.4) She also regularly cooked meals for those in need. “My mother was the original ‘Meals on Wheels’ person,” Fred remembered. “Whenever she heard of someone who was sick or hungry, she’d show up wherever they were with a covered dish.”5 She spent time at the hospital on a regular basis, rocking babies in the nursery.6 And when children or families were in need, the nurse at the elementary school would order shoes, coats, eyeglasses, or even furniture and have the bills sent directly to Nancy Rogers. — location: [279]() ^ref-40888

Latrobe still claims Fred as its own, perhaps especially because he never stopped claiming Latrobe. — location: [316]() ^ref-24048

He graduated salutatorian of his class, and the valedictorian, a young woman named Doris Stewart, was his girlfriend.6 (Doris lived a few blocks down Weldon Street from the Rogers family with her mother, Marguerite Stewart, who had welcomed the flustered Freddy into her home on that terrifying day almost ten years before.) — location: [383]() ^ref-54340

Fred and Jim were lifelong friends. Fred was the best man at Jim’s wedding, and, though they lived in different parts of the country, they wrote letters and visited when they could. — location: [386]() ^ref-43919

“I like you just the way you are” is a core affirmation of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, where it is spoken (or sung) in hundreds of episodes, including the very first one. I like you as you are Exactly and precisely I think you turned out nicely And I like you as you are I like you as you are Without a doubt or question Or even a suggestion ’Cause I like you as you are I like your disposition Your facial composition And with your kind permission I’ll shout it to a star I like you as you are I wouldn’t want to change you Or even rearrange you Not by far I like you I L-I-K-E Y-O-U I like you, yes I do I like you, Y-O-U I like you, like you as you are10 — location: [392]() ^ref-25505

Even after cultivating lifelong friends like Jim Stumbaugh, even after becoming one of the most recognizable, beloved figures of his time, “the need was always there,” Joanne said of Fred, “for being loved, for being capable of being loved.”15 Fred knew that he was not the only one who carried this kind of hunger, and so he made it the guiding principle and central message of his program: you are loved, you are loved, you are loved—and you are capable of loving. — location: [431]() ^ref-51221

Throughout his almost fifty years in television, Fred said no to every voice (perhaps even some internal ones) that told him that to do such and such would generate better ratings or bigger profits: “no” to picking up the pace; “no” to animation; “no” to licensing of merchandise; “no” to moving Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood to network television, or even to a bigger city like New York or Los Angeles. And as he said no to greater speed, more money, and higher ratings, he said yes to quieter goods: thoughtfulness, intentionality, and his own intuition and imagination for the work, — location: [572]() ^ref-63602
