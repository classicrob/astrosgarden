## Highlights
Instead of healing people, the broken health care system is prolonging people’s suffering in too many cases. — location: [73]() ^ref-60889

---
The Divided Mind is about the principles and practice of psychosomatic medicine. — location: [80]() ^ref-49397

---
make the mistake of assuming it refers to how stress makes disease worse, or the stressful consequences of living with a disease. — location: [85]() ^ref-24316

---
Psychosomatic medicine specifically refers to physical disorders of the mindbody, disorders that may appear to be purely physical, but which have their origin in unconscious emotions, a very different and extremely important medical matter. — location: [87]() ^ref-54944

---
They can range from mildly bothersome back pain all the way to cancer, depending on the power and importance of unconscious emotional phenomena. — location: [91]() ^ref-9857

Psychosomatic disorders fall into two categories: 1. Those disorders that are directly induced by unconscious emotions, such as the pain problems (TMS) and common gastrointestinal conditions including reflux, ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, skin disorders, allergies, and many others. — location: [111]() ^ref-28989

---
2. Those diseases in which unconscious emotions may play a role in causation, but are not the only factor. They include autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, certain cardiovascular conditions, and cancer. — location: [114]() ^ref-48588

---
Psychosomatic processes begin in the unconscious, that dark, unmapped, and generally misunderstood part of our minds first identified by Sigmund Freud. — location: [117]() ^ref-58354

---
I gave this book the title The Divided Mind because it is in the interaction of the unconscious and conscious minds that psychosomatic disorders originate. — location: [119]() ^ref-41727

The most glaring example of this is the idea that an inflammatory process is responsible for many painful states, for which there is no scientific evidence. — location: [134]() ^ref-43238

Psychosomatic disorders belong to a larger group of entities known as psychogenic disorders, which can be defined as any physical disorders induced or modified by the brain for psychological reasons. — location: [174]() ^ref-27296

emotional overlay. — location: [182]() ^ref-41247

---
The third psychogenic group is the exact opposite of the second: it covers cases in which there is a reduction of physical symptoms in an existing disorder. — location: [184]() ^ref-65010

---
In one of the earliest studies of pain, Henry Beecher of Harvard reported that in a group of severely wounded soldiers in World War II, it was found that despite the severity of their injuries they often required little or no analgesic medication because their pain was substantially lessened by their becoming aware that they were still alive, being cared for and removed from the dangers of deprivation, hardship, and sudden death. — location: [185]() ^ref-58354

---
By far the most important psychogenic categories are the fourth and fifth groups, hysterical disorders and psychosomatic disorders. — location: [188]() ^ref-19943

---
The symptoms of hysterical disorders are often quite bizarre. The patient may experience a wide variety of highly debilitating maladies, including muscle weakness or paralysis, feelings of numbness or tingling, total absence of sensation, blindness, inability to use their vocal cords, and many others, all without any physical abnormalities in the body to account for such symptoms. — location: [191]() ^ref-34096

---
The absence of any physical change to the body indicates that the symptoms are generated by powerful emotions in the brain. Just where in the brain, no one can say for sure. One medical authority, Dr. Antonio R. Damasio, has suggested that these emotion-generating centers are located in the hypothalamus, amygdala, basal forebrain, and brain stem. The patients perceive symptoms as though they were originating in the body when the appropriate brain cells are stimulated. — location: [195]() ^ref-19901

---
the brain induces actual physical changes in the body. — location: [201]() ^ref-59375

---
By contrast, in the fifth psychogenic group, psychosomatic disorders, the brain induces actual physical changes in the body. — location: [200]() ^ref-23614

---
tension myositis syndrome (TMS), — location: [201]() ^ref-21807

---
this condition, the brain orders a reduction of blood flow to a specific part of the body, resulting in mild oxygen deprivation, which causes pain and other symptoms, depending on what tissues have been oxygen deprived. — location: [202]() ^ref-13292

---
One of the most intriguing aspects of both hysterical and psychosomatic disorders is that they tend to spread through the population in epidemic fashion, almost as if they were bacteriological in nature, which they are not. — location: [204]() ^ref-39209

---
Strange as it may seem, people with an unconscious psychological need for symptoms tend to develop a disorder that is well known, like back pain, hay fever, or eczema. This is not a conscious decision. — location: [206]() ^ref-63348

---
A second cause of such epidemics often results when a psychosomatic disorder is misread by the medical profession and is attributed to a structural abnormality, such as a bone spur, herniated disc, etc. — location: [208]() ^ref-16555

---
third condition that fuels such epidemics: the simple fact that medical treatment may be readily available. A paper published in the journal Lancet in 1996 described an epidemic in Norway of what is called “whiplash syndrome.” People involved in rear-end collisions, though not seriously injured, were developing pain in the neck and shoulders following the incident. Norwegian doctors were puzzled by the epidemic and decided to investigate. They went to Lithuania, a country with no medical insurance, and on the basis of a controlled study determined that the whiplash syndrome simply did not exist in that country. It turned out that the prevalence of whiplash in Norway had less to do with the severity of rear-end collisions than with the fact that it was in vogue; doctors couldn’t explain the epidemic and the ready availability of good medical insurance for treatment!

The type of symptom and its location in the body is not important so long as it fulfills its purpose of diverting attention from what is transpiring in the unconscious. — location: [221]() ^ref-40169

---
For instance, if a treatment—let’s say surgery—neutralizes a particular psychogenic symptom, so that the symptom loses its power to distract, the brain will simply find another target and create another set of symptoms. — location: [230]() ^ref-37499

---
These disorders afflict millions and cost the economy billions of dollars every year in medical expenses, lost work time, compensation payments, and the like. — location: [246]() ^ref-48632

---
The tissues that may be targeted by the brain include the muscles of the neck, shoulders, back, or buttocks; any spinal or peripheral nerve; and any tendon. As a consequence, symptoms may occur virtually anywhere in the body. The nature of the pain varies depending on the tissues involved: muscle, nerve, or tendon. In addition to pain, nerve involvement brings with it the possibility of feelings of numbness and tingling and/or actual muscle weakness. These reflect the function of nerves, which is to bring sensory information to the brain and carry movement messages to the body, either or both of which may be affected in TMS. — location: [262]() ^ref-64733

---
The fact that patients recover rapidly when they are appropriately treated suggests that the tissues involved—nerve tissue being the most sensitive—are not in any way damaged but only rendered temporarily dysfunctional. — location: [267]() ^ref-12791

---
In the last thirty-five years, three of the above conditions have been so often misdiagnosed that their incidence has reached epidemic proportions. They are: 1. Chronic pain from back, neck, shoulder, and limbs 2. Fibromyalgia 3. Carpal tunnel syndrome — location: [304]() ^ref-4722

---

The reason for this epidemic is the stubborn resistance of the medical profession to even consider the likelihood of mindbody disorders. — location: [315]() ^ref-55322

---
an unconscious desire on the part of the sufferer for some kind of benefit from the symptom, such as sympathy, support, release from responsibility or from arduous labor, monetary gain, and so on. — location: [320]() ^ref-40804

---
As we shall see, the true cause of the pain, TMS, serves the purpose of primary gain, that is, to prevent the conscious brain from becoming aware of unconscious feelings like rage or emotional pain. There is rarely secondary gain. — location: [324]() ^ref-33256

---
As noted above, mindbody disorders tend to spread in epidemic fashion: a. if they are in vogue; b. if they are misdiagnosed, that is, if the pain is falsely attributed to some purely “physical” phenomenon, like a herniated disc or bacteria in the stomach; and c. if treatment is readily available and funded by medical insurance. — location: [326]() ^ref-34852

The medical profession bears a heavy responsibility for this and for the other epidemics. — location: [331]() ^ref-7521

The marketplace and economic factors have taken over. — location: [343]() ^ref-46288

In fact, it is a severe form of TMS. Significantly, fibromyalgia patients commonly suffer from other mindbody disorders as well, like headache and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as emotional symptoms including anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. — location: [349]() ^ref-49807

neurasthenia. — location: [359]() ^ref-27706

---
generally accepted diagnosis is that the nerve is compressed as it passes under a ligament at the wrist, and the recommended treatment is to inject a steroid under the ligament, or cut it, which sometimes produces symptomatic relief. However, a paper published in the journal Muscle and Nerve suggests that nerve function returns too rapidly after the ligament has been cut to blame compression for the disorder, and that it is more likely that local ischemia (reduced blood flow) is responsible for the symptoms. — location: [365]() ^ref-8669

---
What fueled the spread of CTS was the belief that the problem was caused by working at computer keyboards, and that CTS was one of a number of “repetitive stress injuries.” — location: [371]() ^ref-11128

---
Why is it that the millions of men and women who pounded typewriters since the beginning of the twentieth century never developed CTS? Again, medicine bears the responsibility for these epidemics on two counts: first, by failing to make the correct diagnosis, and then by attributing the epidemics to structural and other specious causes, thereby contributing to the severity and long-term nature of symptoms. — location: [377]() ^ref-19676

---
The sad reality is that most of the people suffering from conditions like chronic pain, fibromyalgia, and CTS will not accept a psychosomatic diagnosis. — location: [381]() ^ref-59514

The disorders described up to this point are the most common of a very large group, all of them activated by the autonomic-peptide system. — location: [414]() ^ref-60893

---
second group of ailments is associated with the body’s immune system. (Again, we include the peptide communication system because of the role it plays in the interaction between brain and body.) — location: [415]() ^ref-7230

---
immune-peptide system, the disorder may be induced by either overactive or underactive immune function. Overactive immune activity leads to: •  Allergic phenomena (e.g., allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, sinusitis, asthma) •  A large number of skin problems (e.g., eczema, hives, angioedema, acne, psoriasis) The question invariably arises, “Aren’t allergic reactions caused by allergens, like grass pollens?” The answer is yes, but such allergens are merely triggers. They are foreign substances, and the immune system is designed to repel foreign invaders. However, not everyone reacts to grass pollens. If your unconscious mind causes your immune system to overreact, the system is said to be hyperactive or hypersensitive. Both terms denote an allergic reaction. This excessive sensitivity of your immune system is not to protect you from foreign substances, but to keep your conscious attention focused on the body. Conversely, the unconscious mind may do the opposite to deflect attention from itself. It may decrease the efficiency of the immune system and render the person susceptible to infection. Recurrent infections of any kind are usually an indication of this process. The infections must be treated “medically,” but they will continue to recur if they are not treated psychologically as well. It is highly significant that many of the people suffering from the pain of TMS who have participated in our therapeutic program have reported the disappearance of allergies or frequent infections simultaneously with the cessation of pain. — location: [418]() ^ref-5496

---
Most people with TMS have a history of one or more of these autonomic or immune system conditions. Indeed, it would be most unusual to find someone who has never experienced one or more mindbody symptoms. One is forced to the conclusion that psychosomatic reactions and, therefore, the emotions that cause them, are universal. — location: [430]() ^ref-15100

third medium for transferring mindbody disorders from the mind to the body. It is the neuroendocrine-peptide system, which governs the body’s hormonal distribution. — location: [436]() ^ref-40350

“Central nervous system influences on the immune system are well documented and provide a mechanism by which emotional states could influence the course of diseases involving immune function. — location: [448]() ^ref-51749

---
it is likely that the neuroendocrine network is also responsible for bulimia, anorexia nervosa, and neurasthenia. — location: [452]() ^ref-45977

---
Bulimia, anorexia nervosa, and neurasthenia are quasi-physical equivalents of TMS. Experience strongly suggests that anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), all purely emotional conditions, are equivalents as well. — location: [454]() ^ref-16646

---
Recalling the symptom imperative mentioned earlier, I have observed that some patients, upon being relieved of the pain of TMS by some chemical therapy or a placebo, become anxious or depressed rather than developing another physical symptom. But then when their emotional symptoms were relieved by a tranquilizing or antidepressant medication, their body pains returned! — location: [456]() ^ref-54322

---
placebo effect may be dangerous because of the symptom imperative, but treating the symptom rather than the cause is poor medicine in any event because it is almost invariably temporary, whether or not it leads to a substitute symptom. — location: [471]() ^ref-22161

---
Experience suggests that in the United States only 10 to 20 percent of people with a psychosomatic disorder are able to accept the fact that their symptoms are emotional in origin. Many are downright hostile to the idea. — location: [479]() ^ref-48041

stigma — location: [482]() ^ref-4999

---
“It’s all in your mind” is almost insulting, implying there’s something strange or weak about you or that the symptoms are in your imagination. This is most unfortunate, since the symptoms are very real, the result of a very physical process. — location: [483]() ^ref-43426

Much of the skepticism of psychosomatic therapy demonstrated by patients is strongly reinforced by the medical profession, including much of the psychiatry community. — location: [493]() ^ref-40804

---
People much prefer a diagnosis that suggests they can get better with a “quick fix”: an injection, a medication, a manipulation, even surgery. Many patients come to see me only after they have tried all of the above. — location: [494]() ^ref-49875

Since the mid–twentieth century the physical specialties of medicine have moved increasingly farther away from the idea that the brain can bring about physical alterations in the body and that psychosomatic disorders exist. — location: [496]() ^ref-58027

Psychosomatic symptoms involving other systems (e.g., gastrointestinal, genitourinary, dermatologic) are usually treated with medication, diet, and so on. — location: [504]() ^ref-6138

Medical research has become more laboratory oriented in the last fifty years. To be sure, this shift has produced some impressive results.

There is abundant anecdotal evidence in the medical literature that psychological factors influence more serious disorders like those of the autoimmune group, cardiovascular conditions, and cancer. Yet scientific medicine has paid scant attention to this evidence in its research, with the National Institutes of Health conspicuous in its indifference. Put bluntly, emotional factors should be studied as risk factors in these life-threatening disorders, and they are not. — location: [517]() ^ref-1291

---
Another trend in contemporary scientific medicine is its preoccupation with studying the anatomy, physiology, and chemistry of the brain, at the expense of studying its dynamic relationship to the body as a whole. — location: [520]() ^ref-60360

It would appear that modern psychiatry has regressed back to the nineteenth century, when the predominant view of mental disorders was that they were either hereditary or due to brain disease.

Because of the importance of the symptom imperative, I’m going to repeat the rationale behind it. If the psyche has induced a physical symptom (such as back pain) or an emotional symptom (such as depression), which is then temporarily relieved in some fashion without dealing with the underlying emotional dynamic, the psyche will simply create another symptom to take its place. — location: [699]() ^ref-52397

One of Freud’s biographers, Peter Gay, describes the unconscious as a maximum security prison where all the desperate criminals (i.e., dangerous feelings) are kept under heavy lock and key. The analogy is helpful in understanding the psychology of psychosomatic disorders, for it is the drive of these feelings to come to consciousness (the attempt of criminals to escape) that necessitates symptoms to prevent that from happening. — location: [867]() ^ref-34973

---
Freud observes this very thing: “We must rather attribute [to] the repressed [ideas] a strong upward drive, an impulsion to break through into consciousness.” The unconscious mind, it would seem, wants to join the conscious mind. — location: [871]() ^ref-52907

I was forced to the same conclusion because I could find no other way to explain the development of the symptoms in TMS except to see them as a deliberate distraction designed to prevent the dangerous, painful emotions of the unconscious from becoming part of conscious experience. — location: [874]() ^ref-20384

---
Our studies of TMS lead us to conclude that repression serves a protective purpose since the repressed emotions, should we become aware of them, would in some way be dangerous to normal existence or be too emotionally painful to deal with. — location: [879]() ^ref-5343

According to Freud, the repressed ideas were reprehensible, unacceptable, often loaded with sexual content, and therefore the purpose of repression/resistance was to keep them hidden and to thwart any attempt at analysis. — location: [877]() ^ref-38777
