My sense of self is non-existent. I don't have a sense of self. 

I think [[people pleasing]] is my main characteristic? I also have a moral and ethical code I abide by and a strong sense of justice but other than that, my sense of self is not even an abstraction, but a void. 

I think trying to be helpful, trying to say something cool, trying to be funny. I constantly [[self-censor]] and I can't be myself because I'm too busy trying to sound like I'm worth whatever time and attention others are giving me. I have [[self-imposed]] pressure to say something either profound or funny, add value to conversation. It's like everything I say is what I think the person would like. The kind of conversation is totally dependent on the other person and their interests. Despite this, all I do are make lame jokes or sound pretentious. I [[presumptions|presume]] automatically that people hate me or think I'm annoying. That's my inner [[monologue]] at all times. Also causes a lot of shame because I scrutinize every little action I make and then shame myself for doing it. Like, "Wow, really? That's what you decided to say?"
